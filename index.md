SpireBooks uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) to automatically run ESLint and TestCafe each time a commit is made to the default branch.  You can see the results of all recent "workflows" at [https://github.com/Team-Half-and-Half/spirebooks/actions](https://github.com/Team-Half-and-Half/spirebooks/actions).

## Deployment
## Development History
The development process for SpireBooks conformed to Issue Driven Project Management practices. In a nutshell:

- Development consists of a sequence of Milestones.
- Each Milestone is specified as a set of tasks.
- Each task is described using a GitHub Issue, and is assigned to a single developer to complete.
- Tasks should typically consist of work that can be completed in 2-4 days.
- The work for each task is accomplished with a git branch named "issue-XX", where XX is replaced by the issue number.
- When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged into master.
- The state (todo, in progress, complete) of each task for a milestone is managed using a GitHub Project Board.
- The following sections document the development history of SpireBooks.

### Milestone 1
The goals for Milestone 1 are to have several mockup pages and acceptance tests.

Milestone 1 was managed using [SpireBooks Github Project Board M1](https://github.com/orgs/Team-Half-and-Half/projects/1/views/1).

### Milestone 2
The goals for Milestone 2 are to add functionality to the pages and to setup our databases.

Milestone 2 was managed using [SpireBooks Github Project Board M2](https://github.com/orgs/Team-Half-and-Half/projects/5/views/2).
